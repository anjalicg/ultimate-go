## Pointers

Pointers provide a way to share data across function boundaries. Having the ability to share and reference data with a pointer provides flexbility. It also helps our programs minimize the amount of memory they need and can add some extra performance.

## Notes

* Use pointers to share data.
* Values in Go are always pass by value.
* "Value of", what's in the box. "Address of" ( **&** ), where is the box.
* The (*) operator declares a pointer variable and the "Value that the pointer points to".
