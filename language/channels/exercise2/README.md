### Exercise 2
Write a program that uses a fan out pattern to generate 100 random numbers concurrently. Have each goroutine generate a single random number and return that number to the main goroutine over a buffered channel. Set the size of the buffer channel so no send every blocks. Don't allocate more buffers than you need. Have the main goroutine display each random number is receives and then terminate the program.
